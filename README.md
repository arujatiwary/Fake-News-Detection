This repository contains the implementation and findings from a research project titled "Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Approaches for Fake News Classification." The project evaluates and compares the performance of four machine learning algorithms—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting—on the task of fake news classification.
We not only analyzed their raw accuracy but also focused on generalization performance, using techniques like regularization, pruning, feature selection, and k-fold cross-validation to reduce overfitting and improve model robustness.
